Description: ASICS works relying on a library of pure metabolites spectra to 
    quantify metabolites concentration in a complex spectrum. The identification 
    of metabolites is performed by comparing the spectrum of the mixture with 
    spectra of the library. These comparisons are carried out using a 
    statistical theory with established statistical properties 
    (Tardivel et al. 2017).
