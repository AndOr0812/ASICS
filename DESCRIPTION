Description: With a library of pure metabolite spectra, ASICS quantifies 
    metabolites concentration in a complex spectrum. The identification of 
    metabolites is performed by fitting a mixture model to the spectra of the
    library with a sparse penalty. The method and its statistical properties 
    are described in (Tardivel et al. 2017).
